## About the Video Course
DevOps is becoming a reality in the IT workplace. Being able to master and manage the basic tools for DevOps is the first step towards success. This video course shows you how to adopt a DevOps way of working, with Azure.

You might have come across slow development cycles due to traditional infrastructure management processes. DevOps, reduces the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production.

This course will show you how to speed up the release cycle of your IT systems. With a set of automation tools, an orchestration platform, and a few processes, you will do more with fewer resources and become more engaged in the business process. Exploring Azure, youâ€™ll learn various solution architectures with continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline that push your changes automatically to cloud, allowing you to deliver value faster to your customers.
